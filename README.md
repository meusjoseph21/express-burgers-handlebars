# EAT-DA-BURGER

  ## Description

  the Eat-Da-Burger application is an application that is meant to simulate deciding to DEVOUR a burger and enter new burgers into the mix. Realistically this application was developed to work with mysql, express, and express-handlebars. When you enter the data it is stored within a database that is referenced from mysql. This assignment was not super challenging but it will be important that I am able to use all of this again and include sequelize for project one
